# Most Shared 3D Printing Models? Printer Upgrades

## Data from a top 3D model sharing site highlights the technology's limitations, as most models focus on upgrading printers rather than other applications.

## Overview

This analysis dives into data from a top 3D model sharing site to highlight the technology's limitations, as most models focus on upgrading printers rather than other applications.

## Objective

The main goal of this analysis is to identify which types of 3D printing models are most popular and heavily downloaded, with a particular focus on how many of these models are intended for upgrading the printers themselves.
